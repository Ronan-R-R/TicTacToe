# TicTacToe
Basic TicTacToe game in Java that includes simple UI along with 2 modes

## Modes include:
- PvP or player vs player, requires 2 users to play
- PvE or Player vs AI, AI is a strech as it's only playing randomly unless it sees a win for either it for the player whereby it will act to either win or block
 
## Do Note:
- No highscore/ winstreak are not gonna happen as I'm still learning and it may be better for my sanity to not revist this
- minimal comments and info where made, should be simple enough
- it's a bit of a mess of IFs so feel free to come up with something better
- UI is very basic due to it being my first attempt
